# Explainable Short-Horizon Stock Selection

A machine learning framework for short-horizon stock selection, optimized for **Top-K return performance** and enhanced with **SHAP-based interpretability**.

---
## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to identify stocks with strong return potential over the next 5 trading days.

Instead of focusing on classification accuracy alone, this project emphasizes:

* Cross-sectional ranking
* Top-K return performance
* Model interpretability (SHAP)

---

## 🎯 Objective

Given a set of features for each stock on each trading day, predict whether the stock will achieve positive returns over the next 5 days.

**Target definition:**

```text
regime_binary = 1 if r_future_5 > 0.01 else 0
```

**Data split:**

* Train: before 2023
* Test: after 2023

---

## 🧠 Key Ideas

* Treat stock prediction as a **ranking problem**
* Focus on **Top-K return instead of accuracy**
* Compare multiple models and preprocessing methods
* Use SHAP to understand model behavior

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains **7,167,829 observations** across **3,876 Chinese A-share stocks**, covering the period from **2016-10-17 to 2026-01-19** (2,251 trading days).

Each row represents a **stock-day observation**, and the dataset is structured as a cross-sectional panel.

The dataset is not included in this repository.

## 🧪 Feature Engineering

Feature construction follows a combination of **momentum, trend, and mean-reversion signals**.

### 1. Return-based Features

- `ret_1d`, `ret_3d`, `ret_5d`, `ret_10d`
- Capture short- and medium-term returns

---

### 2. Delta Features (automatically constructed)

The following features are generated in the data pipeline:

- `ret_1d_minus_5d = ret_1d - ret_5d`
- `ret_3d_minus_10d = ret_3d - ret_10d`
- `ret_1d_minus_3d = ret_1d - ret_3d`

These features capture **acceleration and trend change**.

---

### 3. Momentum Features

- `roc_20`
- `momentum_change`

Used to measure trend strength and continuation.

---

### 4. Trend Features

- EMA slopes:  
  `ema30_slope`, `ema60_slope`, `ema90_slope`, `ema180_slope`

- MA slopes:  
  `ma30_slope`, `ma60_slope`, `ma180_slope`

These features reflect **direction and strength of trends**.

---

### 5. Mean Reversion Features

- `bias_60`
- `bias_60_vr`

Capture price deviation from long-term averages.

---

### 6. Cross-sectional Features

- `board_rank_20d_pct`
- `board_rs_20d`

Measure **relative strength within the market**.

---

### 7. Market & Breadth Features

- `macro_regime_3`
- `trend60`
- `breadth_mom`
- `dispersion`
- `vol20`
- `high20_ratio`

Provide **market-wide context and regime information**.

---

### Final Feature Set

The final training feature set is selected from a predefined feature group in the pipeline:

- `BASELINE_PLUS_LONGER_TREND_RAW_FEATURES`

and processed through:

- Missing value filtering
- Time-based split
- Quantile clipping (to remove outliers)

## ⚙️ Pipeline

1. Data loading
2. Feature engineering
3. Label construction
4. Outlier clipping
5. Train-test split (time-based)
6. Preprocessing:

   * raw
   * z-score (cross-sectional)
   * standard scaling
7. Model training
8. Evaluation
9. SHAP analysis

## 📊 Model Performance

### Overall Comparison

![Top5 Return](figures/bar_top5_future_return_all.png)

> XGBoost and LightGBM achieve the highest Top 5% future return, indicating strong ranking ability for identifying high-return stocks.

---

![Top5 Hit Rate](figures/bar_top5_hit_rate_all.png)

> Tree-based models consistently outperform others in hit rate, suggesting better classification of positive-return opportunities.

---

### Grouped Comparison

![Grouped Return](figures/grouped_top5_future_return.png)

> Z-score preprocessing slightly improves performance for some models, but tree-based models remain robust across preprocessing methods.

---

![Grouped AUC](figures/grouped_auc.png)

> MLP and Logistic Regression benefit more from standardization, while tree-based models are relatively insensitive to preprocessing.
 ## 📊 Model Performance Analysis

Several key patterns emerge from the results:

- **Tree-based models dominate return-based metrics**  
  XGBoost and LightGBM consistently achieve the highest Top-K returns.

- **AUC is not aligned with investment performance**  
  Models with higher AUC (e.g., MLP) do not necessarily deliver better Top-K returns.

- **Preprocessing mainly affects linear and neural models**  
  Standardization improves Logistic Regression and MLP significantly, while tree models remain stable.

> These findings confirm that **ranking ability is more important than classification accuracy** in stock selection.
## 🔍 SHAP Analysis

We select **XGBoost (raw features)** as the final model based on Top 1% return.

### Global Feature Importance

![Global SHAP](shap_outputs_xgboost_raw/global_shap_bar.png)

> The most important features are dominated by momentum and relative strength signals, such as `board_rs_20d`, `roc_20`, and `bias_60`.

---

### SHAP Summary Plot

![SHAP Summary](shap_outputs_xgboost_raw/global_shap_summary.png)

> High values of momentum-related features tend to push predictions upward, while mean-reversion features show negative contributions.

---

### Top 1% Feature Importance

![Top1 SHAP](shap_outputs_xgboost_raw/top1_shap_bar.png)

> In the highest-return group, momentum and trend signals become even more dominant, highlighting their importance in extreme winners.

---

### Stability Across Years

![SHAP 2023](shap_outputs_xgboost_raw/year_2023_shap_bar.png)
![SHAP 2024](shap_outputs_xgboost_raw/year_2024_shap_bar.png)
![SHAP 2025](shap_outputs_xgboost_raw/year_2025_shap_bar.png)

> Feature importance remains highly consistent across years, suggesting stable predictive patterns rather than overfitting.

## ⭐ Key Insights

- **Momentum effect**  
  High `board_rs_20d`, `roc_20` → higher probability of future gains  

- **Trend effect**  
  Positive slope features (EMA / MA) → bullish signals  

- **Mean reversion**  
  High `bias_60` → negative contribution  

> The model captures a combination of:  
> **Momentum + Trend + Mean Reversion**
